# Employee Tracker

## Description

- My Motivation for this project was to use and further understand how SQL works.
-I built this project so that I can improve my skills in SQL and other languages we have learned so far.
- This solved the issue of having to go into the code to view, add and update the Employee Tracker, adding and updating as needed.
- I learned that I can surely use more practice in SQL
